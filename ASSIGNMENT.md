# Practical Project Assignment for the [Software Technologies Course @ SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/courses/software-technologies)

Design and implement a **simple Web-based application** , e.g. **blog** / **forum** / **photo album** / **listings site** / **other**.

## Technologies by Choice

Use are free to choose the **technology stack** for your project development, e.g.

- HTML + CSS + **JavaScript** + AJAX + REST + JSON + Kinvey mBaaS
- **PHP** + MySQL + Apache + HTML + CSS
- C# + **ASP.NET MVC** + Entity Framework + SQL Server + HTML + CSS
- Java + **Spring MVC** + Hibernate + MySQL + Tomcat + HTML + CSS

You are allowed to use in addition other **technologies** like Bootstrap, SASS, LESS, MongoDB, Node.js, etc. You are allowed to use **frameworks** like AngularJS, ReactJS, Laravel, Symfony, Nancy, Spark, Play, JSF, etc. You are allowed to use **development tools** , **libraries** and **resources** like Web design templates, code generators, code libraries, JavaScript libraries, PHP composer packages, .NET NuGet packages, Java Maven artefacts and others.

## Team by Choice

You are allowed to work in a **team by choice** or to work **individually**.

Requirements for the **team projects** :

- All team members should be part of the &quot; **Software Technologies**&quot; course at SoftUni.
- **Onsite** and **online** students can work together (mixed teams).
- Teams can have **up to 6 members**.
- All team members should use source control repository (like GitHub).
- Larger teams should develop larger projects (see below).

Requirements for **individual** projects:

- Students are allowed to **work alone** without a team.
- Individuals should use source control repository (like GitHub).

Everyone should use a **source control system**.

- Use **Git** or other source control system for your project development.
- Use **GitHub** , **Bitbucket** , **CodePlex** or other team collaboration platform.
- Your **source code** should be open-source and **public** in Internet.

## Project Scope

Your project should implement **at least** the following **functionality** :

- User **registration** , **login** and **logout**.
- **View** some content (e.g. blog articles, listings, photos, issues, publications).
- **Create** new content (e.g. post new blog article, post new listing, upload new photo, create new issue).

Your project should keep its data in a **database** or in a **backend service** :

- Use at least **2 tables** ( **collections** ) with a relationship, e.g. users and blog posts.
- Use a **database** (like MySQL or MongoDB) or cloud-based backend (like Kinvey, MongoLab or RedisLab).

Your project should implement **at least 4 pages** (views).

You are allowed to create a project which is **very**** similar to the &quot;Blog System&quot;** developed during the course. You are allowed even to take the Blog System source code and modify it for your needs.

### Requirements for the Individual Projects

Individual projects can be **small** , like the &quot;Blog System&quot; developed during the course.

- Minimum **4 pages** (views) and **2 database tables**.
- Implement user registration, login, view content, create content.
- **Optionally** implement more functionality.

### Requirements for the Team Projects

Larger teams should develop **larger projects**. The minimum number of application pages and database tables required for the project depend on the **count of team members**.

- Minimum (3 + **team\_members\_count** ) **pages** (views).
- Minimum **team\_members\_count**** database tables** (or data collections / entities).
- Implement user registration, login, view content, create content.
- Implement **more functionality** by choice. Larger teams should implement more functionality.

## Forbidden Techniques and Tools

- Your project should be created mainly by **you and your team**.
- You are **not allowed to copy a project from Internet** and present it as your development.
- You can use external libraries, frameworks and tools, but **not to clone a project** and present it as yours.

## Commit Logs

- Each team member should have **at least 5 commits** (changes) in the project repository.
- Please **commit every day** during the project development to demonstrate your work progress.
- More commits (especially in more than the last 1-2 days) are better during the project assessment.

## Deliverables

Submit the **URL of your project source code** as deliverable, e.g. [https://github.com/nakov/TurtleGraphics.NET](https://github.com/nakov/TurtleGraphics.NET). Each team member submits the same **source code URL**. Put the following assets in the project repository:

- The complete **source code** of your project (PHP, Java, C#, JS, HTML, CSS, images, scripts and other files).
- Any other project assets (optionally): documentation, design, database sample data scripts, tests, etc.
- Don&#39;t commit the **libraries** that can be automatically downloaded by the **package manager** (npm packages, composer packages, NuGet packages, maven packages).

## Public Project Defense

Each team will have to deliver a **public defense** of its work in front of the SoftUni trainers.

The teams will have **only ~15 minutes** for the following:

- **Demonstrate** the application&#39;s functionality (very shortly).
- Show the **source code** and explain briefly how it works.

At least **one team member** should come at the defense.

Hints for better presentation:

- Be **well prepared** for presenting maximum of your work for minimum time.
- **Open all project assets** beforehand to **save time** : open your site in the browser, login and open the user / admin panel in another browser, open your GitHub project page to show the commit logs, etc.
- Test how to connect your laptop with the **multimedia projector** before the defense to save time.

## Assessment Criteria

- **Functionality** – **0…70**
  - **What** is implemented? Does it work correctly? Does it have intuitive UI?
  - How much **effort** you have put in this project?
  - Is the functionality **enough** for the team size (larger teams should deliver more)?
  - What portion of the work is **own code written by your team** and what is ready-to-use framework?
- **Teamwork** – **0…30**
  - **Individual projects** show the **commit logs** in the source control repository.
  - **Team projects** show the **commit logs** and explain the **role of each team member**.
- **Bonus** – **0...10**
  - Bonus point are given for implementing more than expected.
